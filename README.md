Croydon GP 

Welcome to the Croydon GP Appointment Management App repository! This repository contains the files necessary to set up and run the Croydon GP Appointment Management App, a comprehensive solution for managing GP appointments efficiently and effectively.
Files Included
1. Crydon.pbix: This file contains the Power BI dashboard used for the Analytics Page of the application. It provides valuable insights and visualizations based on the data collected from appointments.
2. KaggleV2-May-2016.csv: This CSV file contains sample data used for visualization and key performance indicators (KPIs) in the Power BI dashboard. It includes essential appointment-related information for analysis.
3. Crydon GP (MainApp).msapp: This Power Apps file contains the main application, serving as the frontend for users to interact with. It includes features such as registration, appointment booking, and user profile management.
4. CroydonGP SQL Script.sql: This SQL script file contains the database schema and sample data necessary for the backend of the application. It includes the structure of the database tables and initial data to populate them.

Getting Started
To get started with the Croydon GP App, follow these steps:
1.	Download the Files: 
   - Download the compressed file containing all the files mentioned above.
2. Set Up the Backend:
   - Use a SQL Server instance to run the SQL script provided in `CroydonGP SQL Script.sql` to create the necessary database schema and populate it with initial data.
   - Ensure that the SQL Server instance is configured correctly and accessible to the application.
3. Explore the Frontend:
   - Open `Crydon GP (MainApp).msapp` using Power Apps to explore the frontend of the application.
   - Navigate through the different screens and functionalities to familiarize yourself with the user interface and features.
4. Analyze Data with Power BI:
   - Open `Crydon.pbix` using Power BI Desktop to explore the analytics dashboard.
   - The Analytics page on the application is just an image as the dashboard is not tiled over because of licensing issues, so a user will need to open the dashboard in Power BI to see KPIs in detail.
5. Customize and Deploy:
   - Customize the application and dashboard according to your requirements.
   - Deploy the application and dashboard to your desired environment for users to access.
